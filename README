## Description

This is a simple Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing in length. The game becomes progressively challenging as the snake gets longer and faster.

## Features

- Intuitive controls: Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Food: The snake must eat food to grow in length and score points.
- Scoreboard: Keep track of your high score.
- Game Over: The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
